# ImmigrantCaseStudy

I thought of this project when the topic of immigration came up in a conversation with one of my family members. I noticed that there was a distinct gap in understanding of
immigrant life among people born in the United States. This project uses official Census Bureau data of characteristics of immigrant life in the USA. 

This project is intended to inform people who may not be highly informed (myself included) of how immigrants live in the USA. A secondary case that I thought this could be used 
for is people who are prospective and/or undecided if they would like to immigrate to the United States.
